<h2>From Plumbing to Pen-testing a Journey into the Matrix.</h2>

<h3><u>About Mr m0j0r1s1n</u></h3>
<div id="featuretext">
<p>
  So where to start, well as you guessed I was a plumber by trade and never followed my dreams.  Now after a few life changing things in my life happened I am now back studying for a CyberSecurity degree with the Open University.  The degree I am doing is called the R60 and during my time studying I have met many fabulous, intelligent and funny people, who all think the same and have similar interests and passions, which is pretty cool!
</p>
<p>Me, well I also love music so for anyone who worked it out my handle m0j0r1s1n is from an anagram that came from the 70's group the Doors and his front man Jim Morrison, add a Mr to the Jim Morrison and it makes sense.

  <p> So a little bit more about myself and some of it can be told by the images to the left.<br>
   So when I was young shortly after my brief encounter with a zx spectrum and an old Amiga (computer interest sparked) but yet to be followed up on.<br>
   I got hooked on music and the stories of Jim Morrison and the Doors, so much so I would <br>
   play the albums until I knew all the words, I got a nickname Jimbo/Mojo.<br>  Then came a moment in my life that would change it forever.  I was diagnosed with chronic pancreatis and life stood still, my days of being a party
   guy where over and my days of sheer mental torture began.<br> That's where the Joker comes into it.
   My moods went from being the Joker to being in the mind of the Joker, pretty dark.<br>
   After the initial shock of what I was told and the realisation of how much life will change, I gathered myself together and went back to work at a struggle only to break my back by simply working to hard, life wasn't going to well.<br></p>
